    <h1>Development Portfolio — IMGD 4000</h1>

    <h2>Role in the Project</h2>
    <p>
      During the Alpha milestone, my primary responsibility was implementing the player movement system.
      For the Beta milestone, I shifted towards interaction and puzzle logic, specifically developing
      the note-pickup mechanic and the portrait bookshelf hint system.
    </p>

    <h2>Challenges and Problem-Solving</h2>

    <h3>1. Alpha Movement Integration Failure</h3>
    <img src="./Images/BP_PlayerController.png" height="600"/>
    <p>
      Initially, I designed the movement system and animations for a freely rotating camera. The player could only move
      forward relative to camera direction, so when our team integrated assets, the character was stuck
      facing forward, unable to turn horizontally. Naturally, the rotate-left/right functionality I had
      implemented became useless in the integrated project.
    </p>

    <img src="./Gifs/Jog_right.gif" height="200"/>
    <img src="./Gifs/Jog_left.gif" height="200"/>
    <img src="./Gifs/Turn_left.gif" height="200"/>
    <img src="./Gifs/Turn_right.gif" height="200"/>
    <img src="./Gifs/Jump.gif" height="200"/>
    <p>
      To synchronize with the project’s fixed camera design, I removed my rotation system entirely.
      I modified input handling so directional keys directly changed the player’s facing direction
      instead of rotating a camera around them. The Alpha character model was Unreal Engine’s default
      mannequin, but later another teammate replaced it with the finalized model and animation set.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Beta Note Interaction Mechanic</h3>
    <p>
      Implementing the note system was relatively straightforward. When the player overlapped a note’s
      collision box and pressed <code>E</code>, I triggered a Custom Event in <code>BP_Note</code>.
      That event spawned and displayed a UI widget (<code>BP_NoteWidget</code>) on screen. Pressing
      <code>E</code> again removed the widget.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/BP_Player_NoteInteraction.png" height="300"/>
    <p>
      This toggle behavior was handled using <code>FlipFlop</code> nodes in Blueprints. The widget Blueprint
      contained simple animations for when the note appears and disappears, helping the interaction feel
      more polished and readable to the player.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Camera Switching for Puzzle Hint</h3>
    <p>
      The most difficult task during Beta was handling the camera transition toward a hallway portrait and
      then returning to normal gameplay. I created a dedicated camera component inside
      <code>BP_Portrait</code> so the portrait could be viewed from a separate cinematic angle. Using
      camera blending, switching to this camera was straightforward but returning was not.
    </p>
    <img src="./Images/BP_Player_Portraitinteraction.png" height="250"/>
    <img src="./Images/BP_Portrait.png" height="300"/>
    <p>
      When blending back, the camera consistently snapped behind the player’s feet instead of returning
      to the hallway camera. After unsuccessful debugging attempts, I discovered that our camera programmer
      had already built a Custom Event specifically for restoring the hallway view. However, calling it
      still produced errors.
    </p>
    <p>
      A teammate suggested re-examining variable assignments. Following that hint, I realized that in the
      details panel, the variable intended to reference the hallway camera was never manually assigned.
      After correcting this reference binding, the issue was fully resolved.
    </p>

    <p>
      This experience reinforced a critical lesson, that not every problem should be solved alone. Asking for
      help revealed overlooked assumptions much faster than trial-and-error debugging.
    </p>

    <h2>Technical Elements Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Blueprint scripting for interaction logic</li>
      <li>Overlap detection and input conditionals (<code>E</code> key interaction)</li>
      <li><code>FlipFlop</code> toggling logic for UI visibility</li>
      <li>UI Widget animation for note appearance/disappearance</li>
      <li>Camera components and camera blending between gameplay and portrait views</li>
      <li>Custom Events for system-level camera switching and restoration</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Lessons Learned</h2>
    <h3>1. Design Alignment Matters</h3>
    <p>
      My Alpha movement system failed because it ignored team-wide camera design assumptions.
      Collaborative projects require alignment early; otherwise, extra work and refactoring
      become inevitable later in the pipeline.
    </p>

    <h3>2. Communication Accelerates Debugging</h3>
    <p>
      The camera bug took far too long to solve because I initially isolated myself while debugging.
      Directly asking teammates revealed the missing variable reference and solved the problem quickly.
      Open communication is often more effective than silently struggling.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Reference Binding Is Critical in Unreal Engine</h3>
    <p>
      Many Unreal Engine issues arise not from complex logic errors but from unassigned or incorrectly
      bound object references. This project reminded me to always check variable bindings in the details
      panel when something “mysterious” happens in-game.
    </p>

    <h2>Version Control Choice and Experience</h2>
    <p>
      We used <strong>Git and GitHub</strong> as our version control tools, mainly due to their familiarity
      and universal adoption among teammates. They provided a reliable workflow for merging Blueprint assets
      and handling level/scene file conflicts. Although Blueprint merging required extra caution, it was
      manageable with communication, clear ownership of assets, and disciplined commit practices.
